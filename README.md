## Present and futute synergies:

### Colectivo Metaficciones

The Metafictions Collective initially rooted in Lake Studios Berlin but now functioning as an expansive international research project driven by artists, delves into themes like Digital Bodies, generative dramaturgies, migrations, nomadism, and decolonial approaches to creation. Their work notably integrates machine learning and generative AI with performance arts, focusing on the intersections of technology, movement, and embodiment explored through the lens of enactivism.
This collective is composed of artists from diverse backgrounds, including Mexico, Spain, the U.S. (Venezuelan-American based in Berlin), and El Salvador (living in France). These artists not only bring a range of cultural insights but also critically engage with the tensions between global north and south perspectives. This tension enriches their artistic exploration, highlighting issues of power, cultural exchange, and the impacts of colonial histories on artistic expression.
Their innovative approach challenges and redefines traditional narratives within the arts, fostering a dynamic dialogue that bridges disparate geographies and ideologies. Through their work, they reflect on the influence of the global north in shaping artistic and cultural norms, pushing the boundaries of how art interacts with and critiques societal structures through the advanced use of AI technologies. Residency en el Centro de Cultura Digital, Mexicoand summit with Red Iberoamericana de Danza  in Fall 2024.

### Artist-in-residence Rewilding Cultures, Croatia

As an artist-in-residence with the Rewilding Cultures program at Radiona in Zagreb, Croatia, I am facilitating the Electric Wonderland 2024 – an international maker/hacker camp and A-I-R set to occur at Kamp Velebit in Baške Oštarije, Velebit Mountains from July 22 to July 28, 2024. This initiative, funded by Creative Europe of the European Union, focuses on exploring innovative approaches to production, inclusivity, and environmental considerations at the intersection of the arts, science, and technology. The Rewilding Cultures (RC) project aims to reflect the evolving landscape of artistic research and production, fostering new perspectives on various aspects of artistic and creative processes, including research, production, presentation, and dissemination. It highlights the importance of responsible participation, particularly in environmental sustainability and vital inclusion matters that cannot be overlooked.In my role, I will facilitate "Metabolic Moments" utilizing contemplative practices such as mindfulness (SATI) meditation and contemplative movement practice. These sessions are designed to articulate moments of reflection and awareness of the notions of generativity and regeneration concerning the concepts of nature and the artificial, emphasizing their relevance for both present and future contexts.

### AI+ART+LAB Platform (initial stages)

An online laboratory dedicated to the exploration, production, presentation, and dissemination in the field of computational creativity, AI, and machine learning. This platform offers courses, roundtables, and think tanks, all from an artist-centric perspective. It features open-source tools, models, and datasets focused on sustainability, inclusion, and addressing biases. Utilizing collaborative tools and approaches, the lab emphasizes decentralization and congestion. Collaborations include Hugging Face (France), Harvestworks (USA), Radiona (Zagreb), Alias by Aliens, Centro de Cultura Digital (Mexico City), Platohedro (Colombia), and Lake Studios Berlin/movimiento.org (Germany).



### Alien Club

Marlon is a member of the Alien Club, which originated during a pivotal workshop held between March 4 and 6, 2024, at Château du Feÿ in Burgundy, France. The workshop focused on the theme of "trust in generative AI" and brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including artists, academics, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and technology experts. This assembly aimed to explore the crucial issues surrounding transparency, ethics, and accountability in AI development and use.
The Alien Club was formed as a direct result of this workshop's collaborative and innovative environment. The discussions and interactions among participants highlighted the need for a continuous and structured dialogue on the ethical implications of AI. As a result, the club was established to foster ongoing collaboration and research, providing a platform for members to explore and address the various challenges and opportunities presented by generative AI technologies. This initiative seeks to bridge gaps between different disciplines and perspectives, ensuring that the development and application of AI are guided by a comprehensive and ethically sound framework.
